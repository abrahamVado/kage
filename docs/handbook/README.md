# Documentation Handbook

## Responsibility
- Curate canonical references for platform architecture, operational runbooks, and integration guides.
- Provide onboarding material for engineers, designers, and partner teams.

## High-Level Architecture
- Documentation organized by domain (`backend`, `frontend`, `mobile`, `database`, `deploy`) with cross-cutting narratives in `system-overview`.
- Markdown sources rendered via a static site generator hooked into the deployment pipeline for preview and production.
- Diagram assets live alongside Markdown with autogenerated alt text and accessibility metadata.

## Conventions
- State management of documentation uses docs-as-code workflows with branch-based reviews and automated linting.
- Super comments `//1.-`, `//2.-` appear in embedded code snippets to keep parity with implementation conventions.
- Individual Markdown files target under 500 lines; split long tutorials into sequenced chapters.
